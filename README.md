# Sort Visualizer

Sort-Visualizer is a platform where students interested in understanding the core concepts of sorting algorithms can view the algorithms running and sorting the elements visually.
<br><br>
### Motivation:
Many researches have proved the hypothesis that visualizations enable the user to comprehend information more effectively, subsequently improving performance in judgments and decisions. It revitalizes the imagination, enhances the involvement with the text and improves mental imagery. Thus, Visualization helps a lot in understanding the concepts not only theoretically but practically also!

### I have implemented this project using React.js which has features like:
- Algorithm visualization for 5 sorting algorithms:
 > 1. Bubble Sort
 > 2. Selection Sort
 > 3. Insertion Sort
 > 4. Merge Sort
 > 5. Quick Sort
- Step-by-step algorithm with example
